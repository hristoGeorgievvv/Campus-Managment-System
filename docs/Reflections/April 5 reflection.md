# Reflection 5 April

### How we did as a group: 
We finished the last part of our project and closed all the issues.
Final fixes and updates were implemented.



### How we improved compared to last week:
We did more online meetings and updated what have done during the week. We made 
sure that everyone was clear with what we should do for the report and videos, along
with finalizing the code and cleaning it up.

Individual reflections:
---

### Areti
This week I worked on the backend for food and getting food orders into the 
database. I worked on a screen where users can view their current 
orders. I also helped with some last minute fixes, with some back buttons 
that didn't always work when the screen was resized. 


### Floris
This week I worked on cleaning up the overly long methods in the client side.
There were a few methods which used duplicate code and spanned ~80 lines. I 
broke them up and tried to reduce the amount of duplicate code. Along with
cleaning up the method, I worked on testing most of the newer entities we
made in the server side, adding equals methods and ensuring that everything
was good. I also worked on the script for video 1 and making small improvements
to my contributions to the report.

### Horia
This week I finished up the Food screen. The CSS took most of the time to implement,
in order to make it look as good as it could be, and I am happy to have seen that my
teammates thought of it as a good job. I also made some pop-ups where they seemed to be
most appropriate. This week I'll rewrite my part of the report according to the feedback
and work on the videos.


### Hristo
This week I fixed an issue whit database holidays table. I will help more with the report and 
work on the videos.

### Luc
this week I started by connecting the food orders in the database to the relevant 
room reservation, and set the foreign key to cascade delete, so now there is no
need to keep track of separately dealing with old orders, as they get deleted along
with the reservation once it expires. Past that, I worked with floris to create 
an outline for video 1, and intend to start filing that shortly

### Milo
This week I finished the client-side method tests and serverside controller test, 
as well as some cleaning up of methods I found during testing. I worked a little on
my individual retrospective video script. This week was very productive for the group
as a whole and am very content with how the product has turned out. In the next week
we will need to focus heavily on the report and videos.

### Peter
This week I made some final touches to the ui. I made all the windows responsive
I made it more smooth and user friendly.
