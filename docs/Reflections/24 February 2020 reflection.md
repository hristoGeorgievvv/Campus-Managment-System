Reflection for each member 24 February

How we did as a group:


Individual reflections:

- Areti
I added an entity for the database on the server side towards the end of the week. In the beginning I wasn't sure what needed
to be done, so I only spent some time looking at the demo application to try and figure out how it works. I think that I should
improve my communication because otherwise when I don't know what to do I will end up doing nothing again. For next week I should
make sure that I know what I need to be working on so that I can actually work on something.

This week I feel like I should have done more to contribute for the team. I was unsure what we needed, and I had some problems with
syncing intellij and sourcetree. I only managed to fix these problems relatively late in the week and as such did not contribute
too much. For the following week I will focus on making sure I know what we need to do, along with generally adding more to the project

JavaFX proved to be a bit harder than expected.
There were some issues with making the GUI work for the others, with JavaFX runtime components missing.
I made a rough design for the Scenes and the transitions. Everything has been hardcoded, and there is no server communication

- Hristo
This week I was working on the database. Milo had modelled it so I took the task to implement it.
Firstly I ran into big troubles connecting to the database but then I figured it out. I thought it would be
easier if the database was hosted on a server so not everyone will have to install software for the db and
changes will be made easily on one DB. I researched about how Spring data and jpa work and created
most of the entities and relationships between them. I was really glad that in the end everything
was working as it should be. I also helped with the UI and implemented the logic changing between stages.

This week I worked on setting up a couple of working server-side controllers with mappings that we could use as our API endpoint, two for 
classrooms and one for buildings. Past that, I try to communicate as much as possible but I still find myself not entirely sure what I should
be working on, but I am using the issue board and keeping myself familiar with the code so that I am able to contribute as much as I can

This week I worked on designing the User Interface. I designed all the views of the project and also 
I made interactive project in Adobe XD, and then exported all of the views image files. I also started working 
on implementing user interface in JavaFX.
