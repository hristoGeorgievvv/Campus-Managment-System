Reflection for each member 02 March

How we did as a group:


Individual reflections:

- Areti
This week I worked on researching authentication and starting to implement some methods to
access user information from the database. I am still trying to figure out how exactly the
backend works, and how to access data in the database. For next week I need to continue
working on the authentication to get it working with at least the username and password as
a plain String.

This week I updated the frontend to look like the mockups which we created. I worked
with Peter to make the new GUI, but now we need to add functionality to it. The update
may mess with existing functionality, so we should make sure that we fix anything
which may have been broken quickly before adding new functionality. I am learning how
our group made the backend and learning how to properly use spring as I am still not too
familiar with it, so I hope to be able to help more on the backend for the following week

This week I worked on moving the design from the mockups I made last week into actual Java program.
I styled login screen, home screen and reservation screen.
