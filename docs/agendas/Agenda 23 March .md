        - Video : creativity exercise, advertisment that contains all the points of our prject.
        - Professional, explain how we implemented the architecture and how the process went

    - How will the video be graded? What should we focus on when creating it
 - What should our priorities be now
    - Report deadline: 1st draft next week, before monday for feedback
    - Have a clean application, (no unusable buttons, pages that go nowhere)
    - Should start working on the draft for the report
 - Any suggestions for improvements (and general feedback)
    - Look at our codestyle
    -  Divide methods with more than 90 lines
    - Should look into mocking for client-side testing
 - Information literacy, general questions on it

# After the CTA meeting
Generally discuss what we should do for the next week and make sure everyone is clear on what they should do

If something is not working properly we should aim to fix it

Make sure everyone knows what the information literacy thing is and is clear on doing it


# Closing
Ensure everyone knows what to do and how to do it. Provide help if they are unsure.

Maybe have some private questions to the TA to clarify anything
