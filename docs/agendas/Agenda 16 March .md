Show our progress on filtering our search results

# Questions

 - Is this use of the issue board better?

 - Any more functionality?
 - Any suggestions for improvements (and general feedback)

# After the CTA meeting
Generally discuss what we should do for the next week and make sure everyone is clear on what they should do\ 
Focus on what the CTA suggested and on making sure everything is functional. \
If something is not working properly we should aim to fix it

 - Question from Floris on sessions for the security system:
    - Http responses and sessions - Why can I not make a single consistent session between the queries? 
    Every time an Http response is made it uses a new session instead of the previously created one

Ensure everyone knows what to do and how to do it. Provide help if they are unsure.

Maybe have some private questions to the TA to clarify anything
