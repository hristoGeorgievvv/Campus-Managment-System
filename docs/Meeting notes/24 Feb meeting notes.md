Date of meeting: 24/02/2020

General notes for what we should do:

- We should update the gradle to include runtimeFX
    - If it is properly updated there should be an option with the gradle run command,
      or there should be an option to use a runtime or something similar

- We should update the database to include dates and a calendar view

- In the food order window, there should be an option to select the restaurants before the food
- Allow a calendar or planner view for the user who wants to reserve rooms in a more organized fashion

Database - Unsure exactly what but something doesnt work entirely properly.
         - Tests could be done from a local database, or could be from a manually created source. Either works

- Add a retrospective after each meeting. Preferably, also add one for the previous week
- Whenever we make a new agenda, make a new agenda and do not simply overwrite the old one

- To check out the mockups, we will probably need to download Adobe xd
