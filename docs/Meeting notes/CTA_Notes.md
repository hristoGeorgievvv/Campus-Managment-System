    - Bike rental

CTA 2:
    - Mockup comments
        - try not to show too much information at once, make things
            smooth and digestable to the user
    
        - List views for bikes especially, map could be viable on 
            rooms but not a high priority
          
        - after rental, return to home menu, maybe have a separate
            rent/return interface depending on user status
        
        - room/bike rental history isn't neccecary
          
    - Bike rental can either be timeslot based or rent/return based
        so bikes per building with a number assignment is sufficient
      
    - Reserved rooms being shown through some sort of calendar is 
        highly reccommended.
        
    - How rooms are implimented is also quite flexible, if lecture halls
        are included as rooms of buildings, could make it so they are only
        bookable by teachers
        
    *NEW FEATURE*
        -Food
         * should be able to order food through the program, options for
            how this looks is incredibly flexible (food to rooms, menus, 
            cafeterias, opening/closing times based on building, etc)
