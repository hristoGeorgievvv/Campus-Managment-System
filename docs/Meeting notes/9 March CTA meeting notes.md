Final CTA meeting 09/03/2020

We should have some idea on how to set admin:
    - Do not allow anyone to create their account as an admin. Maybe make
      it such that we can make other Admins create new admins or make it
      based off of the email they input

Have a different layout in room reservation:
    - Left has all buildings, and the right has all the rooms in the building
        - Show the buildings and rooms in more detail, add location, time, etc

Admin building update screen:
    - Show the current existing information for that building, so you know what exactly it is you are updating

Show information on the location, capacity and such for each room in the room reservation screen.

Make the calendar for reserving rooms more visible, either make the room reservation table there from when you
open the page, or make the button for opening the calendar more visible
    - Make the order more intuitive, make the times read from left to right, or entirely vertical. Make it consistent

 - Make the TU Delft button send to home screen

 Bike reservation : select building and show the number of available bikes in it, etc
    - Check if you have a bike when you enter the page. If you do, make it a return bike screen, but if
      you do not, make it a rent a bike screen.
    - Maybe have a map like screen for the location of a bike

Maybe create an overview button to show all your reservations clearly in one location
